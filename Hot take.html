    <h2>Hot take</h2>
    








    <h3> Jake Browning </h3>
    <p> Jake Browning hasn’t had the best season so far. He was Joe Burrow’s backup — and even backed up Joe Flacco — making him essentially a third-string option. The hot take floating around is that Jake could potentially start for some NFL teams based on what he showed in 2023. But I don’t see it. Jake Browning isn’t ready for a full-time starting job. He peaked in high school, where he racked up awards, but in college he was never truly at the top of the pack. I think Jake Browning will always be a backup — a solid depth piece in the Bengals’ jungle, but not a long-term starter.

     <h4> Is Tee Higgins WR1 </h4>
     <p> Chase is a superstar — one of the best in the league — but is he still the best wideout on the Bengals? In recent games, we’ve seen Tee making the big catches and stacking up touchdowns. So could we see a shift at WR1? Who knows.
My hot take: Chase is going to get more looks toward the end of the season and rack up some huge touchdowns, because defenses will be locked in on Tee Higgins.</p>
