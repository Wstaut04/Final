      <h3> Bengals vs Bills </h3>
<p>
  The Bengals aren’t looking too hot right now, and with the Bills up next, things won’t get any easier. Josh Allen is an MVP-caliber quarterback, so this matchup is going to be a battle.
My prediction: BENGALS BY 3.

<h4> Ravens vs Bengals </h4>
<p> The Bengals beat the Ravens on Thanksgiving. Historically, the Ravens have had the upper hand, and even with home-field advantage, the Bengals’ defense might struggle against Baltimore’s balanced rushing and passing attack. However, with Joe Burrow back and the home crowd roaring, I think the Bengals can keep it close.
My prediction: Bengals by 7 or 3, with a final score of 24–21 Bengals.

<h5> Bengals vs Dophins</h5>
<p> Playing the Dolphins on the road late in the season will be tough. The Bengals will likely be dealing with some injuries by that point, but I still think this is a game they can win — one that could help push them toward a future playoff spot.
My prediction: Bengals win 28–17 </p>
